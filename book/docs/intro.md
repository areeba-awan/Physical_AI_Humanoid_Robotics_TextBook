# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building intelligent humanoid robots. This textbook provides hands-on learning with real code, real simulations, and real-world applications.

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the complete stack for developing Physical AI systems:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Master the communication framework that powers modern robots. Learn nodes, topics, services, actions, and how to build custom packages.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Build and test robots in realistic simulated environments. Create URDF models, configure sensors, and develop digital twins.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Leverage GPU-accelerated perception, navigation, and manipulation. Integrate Isaac Sim with ROS 2 for advanced robotics applications.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Create robots that see, understand natural language, and act intelligently. Implement cutting-edge VLA systems for real-world tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- **Programming**: Intermediate Python skills, basic C++ familiarity
- **Linux**: Comfortable with command line and package management
- **Hardware** (optional): GPU workstation for Isaac Sim, Jetson kit for edge deployment
